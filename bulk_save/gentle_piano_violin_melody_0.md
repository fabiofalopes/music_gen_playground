A gentle piano melody, accompanied by a soaring violin, sets the atmosphere. The tempo is moderate, with a lilting 6/8 rhythm. Piano arpeggios create a sense of movement, while the violin sings a lyrical melody. Harmonies unfold through minor seventh chords, resolving to major chords. Double bass and soft mallet percussion provide subtle rhythmic support. A soft, legato flute enters, weaving a counterpoint to the violin. Dynamics shift from pianissimo to mezzo-piano. Featuring piano, violin, double bass, flute, and mallet percussion.
