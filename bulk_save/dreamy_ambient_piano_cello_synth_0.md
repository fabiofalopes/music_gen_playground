Soft piano arpeggios, ambient synth pads, and subtle cello undertones create a dreamy atmosphere. Tempo is moderate at 90 BPM with a steady 4/4 beat. Main melody is played on piano with repetitive, ascending arpeggios. Harmonies are built with layered synths and cellos, using suspended chords. Piano, cello, and ambient synths are central instruments. The rhythm section features a gentle kick drum and soft mallets. Dynamics range from soft to moderately loud. Setting: a dimly lit, avant-garde art gallery.
